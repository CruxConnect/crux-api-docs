Welcome to the *Internal* CRUX API.

If you are not an employee of Crux and you've found your way here, congratulations.

We are not hiding anything, but these are our internal API calls.
They are not designed for public consumption.
Many of them will even require employee authentication credentials.
These are officially unsupported endpoints.
They are subject to change at any time.

Below, you'll find thorough definitions of each method including JSON requests we're
expecting and sample JSON responses we'll provide.
There are also examples of request scripts with popular coding languages:
* BASH
* HTTPie
* Python
* Node.js.
